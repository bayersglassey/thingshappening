Switch to LimitOffsetPagination!
Also add sth to the API endpoint JS objects to make pagination easier.

Add a more robust filtering system to the controller.

Seeing your list of events should be possible as a TVGuide.
In general, controller's filters should be tied to query params or arguments
to TVGuide or something, so that each page can control which events appear
in its widget.

Add a search page (for events and users).
