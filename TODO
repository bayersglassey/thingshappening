When you load the page w/ tvguide widget, it loads some events...
Then, scroll the tiniest bit: and a few more load!..
So what's being loaded the first time?..

    start__lte:2018-02-04T09:10:12-08:00
    end__gte:2018-02-02T09:10:12-08:00

    start__lte:2018-02-02T22:27:42-08:00
    end__gte:2018-02-02T09:10:12-08:00

The start__lte is different!.. wtf.
That makes some sense, actually.
That's the same old issue we've been having with view's width
being 0 when the object is created.


Also: seeing your list of events should be possible as a TVGuide.
